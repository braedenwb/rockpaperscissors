# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a basic Rock Paper Scissors web game developed with Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Odin Project

This was the third project in the foundations course of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

## What I learned

During my time developing this project I refreshed my memory on Javascript, expanded my knowledge on Googles Devtools, and improved my skills in DOM manipulation with Javascript.
